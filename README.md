# HIVmodels
This will now be my repository for various HIV models as I keep moving onward.

There are a series of programs that allow the model to be run in compiled C++. The shell script runs the compiled code and then plots it using a python helper script.

The python simple code is used for the adiabatic approximation, as well as just a record of the original simple code.
